# SPARCED notebook

This model is composed of the files generated from the Jupyter notebook located
in the Demo folder of the main branch of the original SPARCED repository.

The main goal is to be able to replicate it into the SPARCED-standard model,
and then delete this "notebook" one.

  - Antimony: replicate approved.
  - SBML: replicate approved.
  - AMICI: differences to investigate.

# About

SPARCED is a simple and efficient pipeline for constructing, merging, expanding
and simulating large-scale, single-cell mechanistic models.

With minimal set-up, users can configure small-scale experiments on their local
machines, is it through pure Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
SPARCED is also compatible with cluster running and parallelization.

The acronym SPARCED stands for _**S**BML, **P**roliferation, **A**poptosis,
**R**eceptor signaling, **C**ell cycle, **E**xpression & **D**NA damage_, which
are sub-models of the large-scale mechanistic model.

## Instructions & Beginners

A beginner's installation guide of SPARCED for newcomers in computer science
is available [here](docs/source/installation-guide.md)

## Replicate our results

You will find specific instructions on how to run the model (including previous
versions) as described in each of our published papers
[here](docs/source/papers).

## Dependencies

We strongly encourage you to use Anaconda and create a conda environment based
on the environment.yml file we provide.

Otherwise, you may base yourself on the requirements.txt file we provide for
the minimal required versions.

## Further information

More information on the model itself can be found in this documentation, in
particular in the [section dedicated to our papers](docs/source/papers).
